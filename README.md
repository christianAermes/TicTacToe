# TicTacToe
This was a coding challenge on [freecodecamp.org](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-tic-tac-toe-game/)

## What does it do?
You can play TicTacToe either against a (bad) AI or another person.
The AI places its ticks randomly on the board, therefore it is like playing against a little kid.

## What I learned
* basic CSS styling
* using vanilla JavaScript
